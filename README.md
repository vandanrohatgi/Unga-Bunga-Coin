# Unga-Bunga-Coin
A meme coin just for learning purposes

# What is this?
In this project I try to recreate [This awesome series on creating blockchain using javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4) in Python.

# Why?

I wanted to learn how blockchains work

# What in the God's name is UngaBunga?
